## Introduction

**QuizMos** is a simple **command-line flashcard manager** that helps you create, review, and organize flashcards for effective studying and memorization.

It allows you to add, list, and remove flashcards—each containing a question and an answer—all directly from your terminal.

QuizMos automatically saves your flashcards to a file, ensuring your collection is preserved and ready every time you run the program.
