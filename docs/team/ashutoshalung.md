## **Overview**

Our product, **Quizmos**, is a flashcard-based quiz application that helps students study effectively through active recall. Users can create, edit, delete, and quiz themselves on flashcards through a simple and intuitive command-line interface.

In addition to the core quiz functionality, I implemented the **Starring Flashcards feature** and the **Storage component**, and contributed extensively to the **JUnit test suite**. These contributions improved both the reliability and long-term usability of Quizmos.

### **Enhancements Implemented**

#### üîπ Starring Flashcards Feature
- Implemented the ability for users to **mark and unmark flashcards as starred** to highlight important ones for focused revision.
- Added support for commands such as `star`, `unstar`, and `list starred`.
- Integrated starred status persistence through the Storage component.
- Updated UI messages to display clear feedback when a flashcard is starred or unstarred.
- Added **JUnit tests** to verify correct command parsing, execution, and storage behavior.

#### üîπ Storage Component
- Designed and implemented the **Storage** system responsible for saving and loading flashcards from a local text file.
- Added support for reading and writing the **starred status** of each flashcard.
- Implemented robust **error handling** for missing or corrupted files, with automatic file creation and recovery logic.
- Refactored serialization and deserialization logic for clarity and adherence to SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).
- Wrote comprehensive **JUnit tests** for Storage, covering boundary cases (e.g., empty files, malformed lines, missing attributes).

#### üîπ JUnit Test Suite
- Significantly expanded test coverage across multiple components, including:
    - `Storage` ‚Äì verifying correct persistence and loading of flashcards.
    - `Parser` ‚Äì validating correct command parsing and error messages.
    - `Command` ‚Äì ensuring consistent behavior for `star`, `unstar`, and `list starred`.
- Created structured test data and setup/teardown logic for isolated test execution.
- Improved reliability of the CI pipeline by ensuring all new test cases passed consistently.

### **Contributions to the User Guide (UG)**
- Authored the **‚ÄúStarring Flashcards‚Äù** section with examples for `star`, `unstar`, and `list starred` commands.
- Added documentation on **data persistence**, explaining how and where flashcards are stored.
- Updated the **Command Summary Table** with all new commands and parameters.
- Edited multiple sections for consistency and formatting improvements.

---

### **Contributions to the Developer Guide (DG)**
- Authored the **‚ÄúStorage Component‚Äù** section describing its structure, read/write logic, and integration with the rest of the app.
- Wrote the **‚ÄúStarring Feature Implementation‚Äù** section detailing the command flow and persistence design.
- Added UML diagrams:
    - **Sequence Diagram** for `StarCommand` execution.
    - **Class Diagram** update showing the new `isStarred` attribute in `Flashcard`.
    - **Activity Diagram** for flashcard saving/loading on startup and shutdown.
- Wrote **Design Considerations** discussing text-based vs JSON-based storage alternatives.

---

### **Contributions to Team-Based Tasks**
- Helped maintain the **GitHub issue tracker** by creating, tagging, and closing issues.
- Assisted with **CI setup and testing pipeline** to include new test cases.
- Supported teammates in resolving file I/O and parser-related bugs.
- Participated in team discussions on architecture and milestone planning.
