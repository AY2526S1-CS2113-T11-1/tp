## Architecture

This section explains the high-level architecture of the application.  
The app follows a **Command-based architecture**, where the user interacts via text commands that are parsed and executed by the system.

### UI Component


### Logic Component


### Model Component

**Responsibilities:**
- Manages the in-memory representation of flashcards.
- Provides methods to add, delete, and search flashcards.

**Classes:**
- Flashcard
- FlashcardList

### Main Component

**Responsibilities:**
- Initializes the application.
- Coordinates between UI, Logic, and Storage components.

**Class:**
- QuizMos

### Storage Component

### Commons Component

**Responsibilities:**
- Contains shared classes used by multiple components (e.g., Messages, Exceptions).

**Class:**
- Exception
- Messages
